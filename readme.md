# Mockingbird
### A simple proof of concept of backbone powered WordPress theme

## Requirement

- This theme requires [WP API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/) plugin to work.
- You need to change the permalink structure to any structure but the default one.

## Notes

This theme is a mere proof of concept of backbone powered WordPress theme. Translation: I'm currently learning Backbone and this theme is my playground for learning it. This isn't meant for production & there are tons of stuff needs to be done.
